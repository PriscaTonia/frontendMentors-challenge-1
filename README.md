## MY PROCESS
So for my process, I started by setting up my HTML file and CSS file, then I got the necessary fonts from Google fonts, and then I tried to map out an algorithm for the tasks, and i started building :)


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned
Okay, so for this project, I practiced styling section by section. What I mean by this is for example, after creating a div, I give that div its required styles.
This method was a bit slow in the begining, but when I got a hang of it, it was okay.
It also made the task easier to complete, why? Because I didn't have to finish writing all of my HTML codes, and then start styling, if I had done that, I'm sure I would have taken more time.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  background-image: url(images/image-header-desktop.jpg);
  /* especially this one here, this allowed me to add the overlay in the background image. */
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 2000px hsla(277, 64%, 61%, 0.3);  
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;
}
```


### Continued development
I would love to learn more on how to be more flexible with grids and flexboxes as I work on more projects.
